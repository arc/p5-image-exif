Revision history for Perl extension Image::EXIF.

99.1  Fri May 21 14:40 PST 2004
	Mr Eric Johnston released new version of his library which is 0.99.1
	So we do!

	From now I'm gonna rename exif.c to _exif.c to allow compile and use
	this package for Win & Mac perl cookers.

	And just small note from Blair Zajac:
	>Hello,

	>I'm looking to use the Image::EXIF module and noticed that the
	>'unknown' hash key is actually spelled 'unknow'.  Since all
	>occurrences of the word are misspelled in the package, is this
	>deliberate?

	>I'm attaching a patch to fix this and a couple of other spelling
	>mistakes.

	>Best,
	>Blair

	Thanks Blair for your note.
	Fixed.

	From Rolf Dignatz:

		using the original Image-EXIF-0.98.5:

		file: nikon0001.JPG

		rd debug: read_data: mark = 0xe1    (JPEG_M_APP1)
		rd debug: exifscan: header='Exif'
		rd debug: read_data: mark = 0xe1    (JPEG_M_APP1)
		rd debug: exifscan: header='http://ns.adobe.com/xap/1.0/'

		(null): couldn't find Exif data 
		
		As you see in my first debug output there are two 
		JPEG_M_APP1-marked sections in the nikon jpeg-file
		and only the first one is the 'real' EXIF section.
		So I decided to break after the first legal EXIF section.

		Another way might be to read all possibly EXIF sections 
		and process them all?
		Similar is the original exiftags-0.98::exiftags.c::doit()
		(code in line ~ 182) which processes each JPEG_M_APP1-section
		which leads in a true expression



	* small fix in create_web_gallery.pl

98.5  Mon Jan 5 11:28:48 PST 2004
	HNY 
	* exifgps.c file was missing in package
	+ also I added script create_web_galley.pl
	  where you can see how I deal with the package

98.3  Mon Nov 10 11:28:48 PST 2003
	* bugfix.
	  EXIF got core dump if jpeg didn't have exif section.
	   based on comment from Sebastien Gross (tnku)
