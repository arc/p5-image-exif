			=======================
			Image/EXIF version 0.98.6
			=======================



Perl Package Image::EXIF based on utility exiftags v0.98
by Eric M. Johnston, emj@postal.net, http://johnst.org/sw/exiftags/.
Actually it's just a wrapper. Weak PHP's support of EXIF
made me write it.
If you wanna improve it - go ahead. I did this module only
because nobody did it before.

I decided keep exiftags version.
And thanks to all of you who send comments and advises.
